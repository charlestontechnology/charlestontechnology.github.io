 If sufficiently addled, this character discharges a thundershock of 
 pure encouragement approaching Richard Simmons intensity. We’re not 
 sure how to defeat something so awful, but rest assured we’re 
 collaborating with Lewis Black, Lego Batman, and those two old guys 
 from The Muppet Show to build a new kind of snark ray. Chuckspirae 
 uses YouTube to stream hip hop lyrics at its haters. If that doesn’t 
 work, it tries a sarcastic greeting card.
