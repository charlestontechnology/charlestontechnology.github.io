 This long-lived Pokéstop draws local startups into a Pokésymbiosis with promises of short-term rent commitments 
 and life-giving Synergy.  It battles its many enemies with a 2.7 knot beam of pure self-congratulation extracted 
 from the life-force of its tenants.  Cooridork apparently also gives loans to Trainers that have pleased it.
