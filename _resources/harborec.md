 This Pok√©gym contains a super-collider deep beneath King Street made of DNA from Patrick Bryant and a mid-80s 
 Xerox copy machine.  Its mentors attract startups during the pupae stage and wrap them in a warm chrysalis of hype.  
 Within this nourishing womb, the blossoming enterprises are bred to fight each other using the power to point, at 
 least until happy-hour.
