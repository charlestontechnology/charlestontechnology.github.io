description: This offpsring of the powers that were has the outward appearance of a cat and the zest and new-economy appeal of a well-established Cracker Barrel.  Its habitat is lonely industrial hinterland where it can lurk and play among the jails, bail bondsmen, the DMV, and be fed by kindly Comcast employees.  The distinct battle cry of Cataliszt sounds like a French horn wrestling with a tuba in a blender.
