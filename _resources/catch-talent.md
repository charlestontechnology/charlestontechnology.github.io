 A rare carnivorous plant that only exists in South Carolina.  Symbiotic 
 with Knotfoss, it gathers resumés from cold-weather organisms with 
 a display of beaches and tales of fine weather.  If you’re lucky you 
 leave with a new job.  If you’re unlucky you’ll be trapped in pluff 
 mud waiting for better pay or high tide.
