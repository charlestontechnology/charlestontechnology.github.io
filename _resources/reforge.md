description: The latest child of Resit0r to spin out into the world.  Reefurge is not really a single Pokémon, but actually many Pokémon living symbiotically within a skeletal structure comprised of ramen noodles and unwashed t-shirts.  As yet untested in battle, it remains to be seen if Reefurge will be able to cohere and thrive.
