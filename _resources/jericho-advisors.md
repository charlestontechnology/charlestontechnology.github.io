description: Jerriachu inhabits the chic Avondale District where it frolics among the vintage furniture and 1940s architecture.  It uses art to disarm its attacker, then extracts creative ideas. Its habitat lacks only for parking which is in short supply unless you're traveling on Savannah Highway.
